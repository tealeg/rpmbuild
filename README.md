This is just my personal rpmbuild workspace - you might be interested to see how I'm building some RPMS, but probably this is not the place to look for "Good Style" in that regard.

This directory structure is the one expected by rpm and rpmbuild for building and maintaining packages.  It is expected to live in your home directory, so you should check it out as follows:

```sh
cd 
git clone git@github.com:tealeg/rpmbuild.git
```
